#DOTCOM Bubble

##  What is the dotcom bubble?
The dot-com bubble was a stock market bubble 
fueled by highly speculative investments in 
internet-based businesses during the bull market
from 1995 to 2000. It saw the value of equity markets 
grow dramatically, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq
index rising five-fold during that period.
