# Context
Consider investing in two stocks: Microsoft and General Electric. As a prudent investor, you analyze the historical performance of the stocks during the period of 1990-01-01 to 2017-12-31. I tried to base my analysis on financial crisis or  other important financial events.

# DOTCOM
The dotcom bubble was an asset valuation 
bubble that occurred in the 90s. 
It led to a recession caused by highly 
speculative investments in internet-based businesses. 
The bubble burst in early 2000 after investors realized many 
of these companies had business models that weren’t viable.

The dotcom bubble was an asset valuation bubble that occurred
from 1995 to 2000 in which investors 
poured money into highly speculative Internet-based companies. 
The dotcom bubble was largely caused by the
lack of due diligence by investors—they invested in 
Internet-based companies without qualifying
an investment with reliable metrics.

## Analysis dotcom period.
In the folder Analysis I created a file named Q4 with the analysis of the entire dotcom period, 1995-2000 and for the seperated year 2000 and 2005.  I analysed this based on the adjusted price which means the difference between the opening price and the closing price.
Based on the graph, the period graph of 1995-2000, the General Electronic has way higher opening prices while Microsoft Electronic kept a quiete consistent price. The General Electronic truly started to peak around 1998 and has more peaks in the opening price . Microsoft electronics kept it more consistent and only had a peak in the opening prices around March 20000.

#  Other analysis
Based on  the data I tried to solve different answers such as. which of the two stocks would have been your best performer during the study period? This question is based on 2010 and  the  monthly return. The analysis are in the folder analysis, file Q1,Q2,Q3.
